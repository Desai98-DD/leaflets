        This unique and ground breaking Leadership Academy is for UFCW 401 members only. All members are welcome to apply.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        The Academy transforms participants into workplace and community leaders and is unlike any previous courses or
        programs UFCW 401 has offered.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Participants focus on personal growth, self-reflection, feedback, and mentoring. There is also a focus on organizing,
        negotiations, health and safety, and understanding the role of a Union Labour Relations Officer (ULRO).
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        The Academy has three levels. Each level requires participants complete 5–8 courses (1–3 days each). Courses may be
        in person or online, and some travel may be required.
