        Working with the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and the United Way, UFCW Local 401 proudly hosts this 2.5-day course
        for interested members.

      <p class="section-text">
        Domestic violence issues members experience in the community often trickle into the workplace. Many of us may not
        know who to turn to or how to help those affected. Some of us may be dealing with it personally and need support.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Participants will work with facilitators from the CLC and the United Way to build a strong base of connection and
        support for those struggling with the realities domestic violence brings.
